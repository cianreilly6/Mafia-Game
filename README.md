# Mafia-Game
This Java program simulates a Mafia-style game to estimate the probability of traitors winning in a group of 22 players. The user is prompted to input the number of traitors. The game is simulated 10,000 times to gather sufficient data for an accurate probability estimate. Each simulation (simGame method) starts with the given number of traitors and the remaining players being faithful. The game proceeds by randomly eliminating players, where the probability of eliminating a traitor or a faithful player depends on the current ratio of traitors to total players. The loop continues until there are fewer than 3 players or either the traitors or faithful players are all eliminated. If at least one traitor remains at the end, the traitors are deemed to have won that simulation. The main method counts how often the traitors win and calculates the proportion of these wins out of the total simulations, outputting the estimated probability of traitors winning.
